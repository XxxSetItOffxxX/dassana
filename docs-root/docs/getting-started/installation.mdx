# Installation

You can get started with Dassana in minutes! (yes, we have timed that ‚è±Ô∏è)

export const LaunchStack = () => (
	<a
		href='https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/dassana-prod-oss-public.dassana.io/latest/cft.yaml&stackName=Dassana'
		target='_blank'
	>
		<img src='/img/getting-started/launchStack.png' alt='Launch Stack' />
	</a>
)

<LaunchStack />


Please note that currently you can deploy the stack only in `us-east-1` region because the lambda functions we publish are hosted in a bucket in us-east-1 region


Parameter Notes:

###### `CrossAccountRoleName`

If you would like Dassana to process alerts belonging to other AWS accounts (i.e., you are deploying Dassana in a "central" account), enter the name of the role that the Dassana Engine
will assume. In a multi-account setup, you typically have a central security account that receives alerts from other AWS accounts. This central account acts as "Delegated Administrator." Please refer to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html) for services that support this kind of setup.

When Dassana receives an alert, it automatically finds out if the alert belongs to a resource in a different AWS account. To access such resources, the Dassana Engine can automatically ["assume role"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html) into the target account.

If such a role already exists, Dassana can use it. This role must have the [SecurityAudit](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit) policy attached to it. The name of this role is what you provide in the `CrossAccountRoleName` during deployment.

If you don't have such a role already available, you can deploy [this CFT](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/pkg/cross-account-role.yaml) using [StackSets in your AWS organization](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-aws-cloudformation-stacksets-for-multiple-accounts-in-an-aws-organization/).

:::warning

Do **not** provide ARN value (`arn:aws:iam::1234567891012:role/MyCrossAccountRoleName`) of the role, just the role name (`MyCrossAccountRoleName`).

:::

Refer to the following diagram:

![Deployment Strategies](/img/getting-started/deploymentStrategy.png)

Do you see that "Access Role"? That's the role Dassana Engine will assume. And yes, that means that the Dassana Engine does have `sts:AssumeRole` permission, but don't worry, it is restricted to the role name you provide.

The CFT deployment takes less than five minutes to complete and creates SQS Queues, Lambda, EventBridge custom bus and an API Gateway. You can review all of the components [here](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/pkg/template.yaml). 

It is expected that you have some basic level of familiarity with AWS such as how Lambda, SQS etc work. 
You do *not* have to write any code if you just want to use out of the box context actions (lambda functions). You can use [Dassana Editor](https://editor.dassana.io/) to configure workflows that are written in YAML format. 


--- 
Security related notes. 

1. Please do no use *root* account when deploying this CFT. 
1. The CFT creates IAM entities and gives specific access to Dassana resources. You can further restrict the access by modifying the template to follow the least privileged principle.
1. As a part of the deployment, Dassana creates a public API endpoint but it is authenticated. More information [here](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/editor/#finding-api-url-and-key)

--- 
Cost related notes. 

1. Except for IAM, all resources created by CFT are billable. Given most Dassana actions finish in less than a second, for most deployments, the actual cost of running this stack is less than a few dollars for millions of alerts processed. 
1. The project itself is free, as in beer and there are no licensning costs.
