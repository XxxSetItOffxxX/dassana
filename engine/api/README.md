## Setup Postman

This folder contains two files:

1. `api.postman_collection.json` - Import this collection into Postman to interface with the APIs supported by Dassana
1. `env.postman_environment.json` - Import this env vars file into Postman so that your API calls have access to the appropriate values. Note that you will need to set your [API gateway url and access key](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/editor#finding-api-url-and-key).
